##twitcrypt

This is an experiment in encrypted Twitter communications. Messages are encrypted with AES-256, and packed in Asian characters to make the data safe for transport. Messages can hold up to 144 bytes of data, though with further optimization, message length can probably be extended.

This is still beta software, so I would use caution with sensitive data until further reviews are completed.
