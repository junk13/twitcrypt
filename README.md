##twitcrypt

This is an experiment in encrypted Twitter communications. Messages are encrypted with AES-256, and packed in Asian characters to make the data safe for transport. Messages can hold up to 144 bytes of data, though with further optimization, message length can probably be extended.

This is still beta software, so I would use caution with sensitive data until further reviews are completed - which is to say - DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE SECURE.

###Usage

* `./twitcrypt -dt <tweet url>` - Get's the content of the tweet and decrypts it. *Doesn't work at the moment*
* `./twitcrypt -ed` - This is primarily for testing; displays the encrypted message.
* `./twitcrypt -dd <message - optional>` - This is primarily for testing; decrypts the message.
    
For all options, you will be prompted for the key, so it is not logged to your shell's history. The `-ed` will prompt for the message, and `-dd` will prompt if no message is passed in.

The maximum message size is 144 bytes. The message is 'encoded' into 100 unicode characters.

###Implementation Details

**Encryption:** 256bit AES in CBC mode, performed via the OpenSSL libraries.

**Key Stretching:** The final key is the first 32 bytes of the provided key concatenated with the SHA256 hash of the key. *(This will be changing)*

**IV:** The is generated by creating a 6 byte 'seed' that is concatenated with the provided key, then SHA256 hashed; only the first 16 bytes are used. The seed is stored in the encoded message.
